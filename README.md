# projectEuler

Project Euler was my first introduction to computing, more specifically computing for mathematically challenging problems.

Here lies all my work for this project, most of which was completed the Spring of my first year in C++

There are files that need to be added that were completed in Python

Eventually I will return with more solutions to the problems...
